# OpenOMF Installation

Note! If you wish to compile OpenOMF from sources yourself, begin from step 2. If you are however downloading a binary release package, you should skip step 2.

## 1. Installation from packages

### Latest experimental binaries

Latest experimental binaries for windows and debian (ubuntu) are available at https://buildbot.openomf.org/artifacts/ . These binaries may not always work correctly, but they will be following the git status very closely. So, if you with to test the latest features, this is for you!

#### Windows

1. Download an appropriate zip file. For 64bit computers, win64 package is available. If you do not know which package to download, get the "-win32.zip" version.
2. Extract the zip file somewhere on your computer. If possible, use a directory other than "C:\Program Files".
3. Install the game resources. Please see step 3. of this guide for this.
4. [optional] If you wish, you may install an xBRZ sprite scaler plugin. This can be found from https://github.com/omf2097/openomf-scaler-xbrz/releases . Note that this is not necessary for running the game.
5. Start the game by running openomf.exe.

#### Debian

1. Download an appropriate .deb file for your architecture (NOTE! 32bit not currently available!).
2. Install the package. You can either run dpkg -i <packagefile> or do it by using graphical tools in your distribution. Note that currently the packages are only tested on debian; Ubuntu may or may not work.
3. Install the game resources. Please see step 3. of this guide for this.
4. Start the game by running ./openomf on command line.

### Official releases

Official releases are (somewhat) stable, but don't necessary come with all the latest bells and whistles. However, if you wish to try them, they will be available at https://github.com/omf2097/openomf/releases . Installation instructions are also available there.

## 2. Compiling from source

### Dependencies

#### Compiler

Use at least GCC 4.7 or Clang 3.1. MSVC is not supported at this time.

Note! For debug builds, GCC 4.9 or later is recommended. With later GCC versions you get better error messages and stricted code quality checks, so if you're doing development, please use the latest compiler version available to you.

#### Libraries

Required:
* SDL2 (>=2.0.2): http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* confuse: http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/
* Gettext (if you have problems with libintl)
* Enet: http://enet.bespin.org/
* libargtable2: http://argtable.sourceforge.net/

Recommended:
* OpenAL: http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html (for audio)
* libxmp: Used for module playback.

Optional:
* libvorbis: https://www.xiph.org/downloads/
* libogg: https://www.xiph.org/downloads/
* libpng: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html (for .PNG screenshots)
* zlib: http://www.zlib.net/
* libdumb (>=2.0.0): https://bitbucket.org/kode54/dumb (for module music)

#### Debian
On debian, it is possible to pull some libraries using apt-get.
```
apt-get install libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev libconfuse-dev libenet-dev libargtable2-dev
```

If you wish to use ogg vorbis and png support, you may also run
```
apt-get install libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libpng-dev
```

#### Mac OS X (Homebrew):
```
brew install sdl2
brew install confuse
brew install enet
brew install gettext
```

### Acquiring the sources

Latest OpenOMF source can be acquired with the "git clone" command below.

```
git clone https://github.com/omf2097/openomf.git
```

Note that the latest sources do not necessarily compile or they may have bugs. To retrieve the latest source that compiles but will be out of date, see the [releases](https://github.com/omf2097/openomf/releases) section of OpenOMF project in github.

### Compiling

To compile (change install prefix if necessary):

```
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
```

Some useful CMake flags:

| Flag                      | Description                             | Choices         | Default |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE          | Chooses between build types             | -/Debug/Release | -       |
| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX      | Installation path                       | -               | -       |
| USE_LTO                   | Use LTO                                 | On/Off          | Off     |
| USE_TESTS                 | Compile unittests                       | On/Off          | Off     |
| USE_OGGVORBIS             | Selects Vorbis support                  | On/Off          | Off     |
| USE_PNG                   | Selects PNG screenshot support          | On/Off          | On      |
| USE_OPENAL                | Selects OpenAL support                  | On/Off          | On      |
| USE_DUMB                  | Selects libdumb support                 | On/Off          | On      |
| USE_XMP                   | Selects libxmp support                  | On/Off          | Off     |
| USE_SUBMODULES            | Pull in libdumb and libsd as submodules | On/Off          | On      |
| USE_RELEASE_SUBMODULES    | Build libdumb and libsd in Release mode | On/Off          | Off     |

Ogg Vorbis support is required if you wish to replace original OMF soundtracks with OGG files. Otherwise the switch is optional.

For music playback, select at least one (or more) of the module player libraries. Available: libdumb, libxmp. Libdumb is recommended.

It is technically possible to select more than one audio sink, or none. Currently only one audio sink is supported (OpenAL). If all audio sinks are off, then no audio will be played. This will also of course reduce cpu usage a bit.

## 3. Data Files

OpenOMF loads the original data files from the original OMF:2097 game. Since One Must Fall 2079 is freeware, the files are obtainable for free from [www.omf2097.com](http://www.omf2097.com/pub/files/omf/omf2097.rar).

On linux in debug mode, the OMF resource files should be put in resources/ subdirectory.

On linux in release mode, the resources should be located in ../share/games/openomf/, relative to the openomf binary. So if your binary is
in /usr/local/bin, the resources should be put in /usr/local/share/games/openomf/. With release or testing packages, the resources should be extracted to /usr/share/games/openomf/.

On MacOS and windows, the resources should be put into the resources/ subdirectory.

Note! Only BK,AF,PIC,TRN,PSM and DAT files are required, others may be removed to save space.

You can override these default paths by setting the OPENOMF_RESOURCE_DIR environment variable to an absolute directory. Plugins have a similiar environment variable called OPENOMF_PLUGIN_DIR.

## 4. Play the game!

Start the game by running the main binary. If there are problems, please contact us by either making an issue ticket, or at #omf @ freenode in IRC (mode details in the [README.md](https://github.com/omf2097/openomf/blob/master/README.md)).
